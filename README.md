Communautée blindée
===================

This is a BuddyPress plugin to fully take advantage of the [Restricted Access Site](https://wordpress.org/plugins/restricted-site-access/) WordPress plugin for your community.

The Restricted Access Site WordPress plugin should be enough to restrict the access to your community, but i've found some edge cases where BP Restricted Community could be interesting:
- You need to allow registrations,
- You need to control the allowed email domains for your regular WordPress (Multisite configs are natively handling it),
- You chose to display one of your WordPress site in the Restricted Access Site options (Settings > General).
- You chose to display the login screen of your WordPress site in the Restricted Access Site options (Settings > General) but you'd like to use your Site's icon instead of the WordPress one at the top of the login form.

Available in french and english.
